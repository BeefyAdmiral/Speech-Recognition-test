# Speech-Recognition-test

### Introduction

Trying to implement a test Speech Recognition for future use with a chat bot. The major goal for this implementation is to test if it is possible to use simple and easily available python libraries for Speech Recognition to get a satisfactory performance. The ideal is to have the **Recognizer** stay on stand-by till it hears a specific response from the user before recognizing any futher commands. 

To further imporove our performance and better the results, **Threading** is used.

### Configuration/Module installation
Speech Recognition: [pip install SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)

Play Sound: [pip install playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/)

### Expectation
The expectation from this test is to get a satisfactory performance while keeping in mind all the features are not affected. Furthermore, have a decent understanding on how different **Virtual Assistants**, like Goolge Assistant, Alexa etc., are able to achieve better results and use that as a comparision to improve on.
